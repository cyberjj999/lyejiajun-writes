# lyejiajun-writes
I learn and I write. I write about technical stuff and productivity stuff.

I founded [The AI Governance Journal](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/introduction-ai-governance-journal-lye-jia-jun/) where I wrote about AI Governance, which was featured in publications such as [Towards AI](https://pub.towardsai.net/).

Also, [I once wrote 1 article a month for a year straight](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/introducing-crystalizemylearning-movement-lye-jia-jun/).
